CODESHA.RE

###

CodeShare is an open-source pastebin-like website. It is created using Ruby and RoR.
Bootstrap CSS, by Twitter, is used for design.

Initially, this was a hack on my other project, Community Blog. (repo's here, btw)
It turned into some little thing for sharing code between people, kind of like pastebin.

also, community blog is no longer in development because of this. :]
i'll be shipping updates quite frequently, i think.
